Hi there! We’re a group of students from the Metropolitan Data I course, taught by Hans Hoogenboom at AMS Institute. Since we don’t know our group number, we have decided to refer to ourselves as “the confused programmers” for now, given our modest coding experience.

This website was created for the purpose of hosting and showcasing our lab results and assignments.

We would like to invite you to explore our work and see our progress. As the course progresses, this website will closely follow our learning journey and showcase our growth.

Thanks for visiting, and we hope you enjoy following along with us!
